Hash Utils
==========

**hash-utils** adds more than 125 useful and frequently rather 
fundamental methods which are missing in Ruby programming language, 
to several core classes. It tries to be similar project to 
[Ruby Facets][1] on principle, but less complex, more practical, 
non-atomic and organized by better way.

- `Array` &ndash; 12 methods,
- `FalseClass` &ndash; 3 methods,
- `File` &ndash; 2 methods,
- `Gem` &ndash; 2 methods,
- `Hash` &ndash; 38 methods,
- `IO` &ndash; 1 method,
- `Module` &ndash; 1 method,
- `Numeric` &ndash; 5 method,
- `Object` &ndash; 13 methods,
- `Proc` &ndash; 1 method,
- `TrueClass` &ndash; 3 methods,
- `String` &ndash; 37 methods,
- `StringIO` &ndash; 1 method,
- `Symbol` &ndash; 8 methods.

For full reference and methods lists, see **[documentation][3]**.

### Modularization

If you don't want to include whole library, you can include extensions 
to appropriate type only by including the:

    require "hash-utils/<lowercase-data-type-name>"
    
### Special Requirements

Some methods are optimized at Ruby 1.8.7 and 1.9 and higher. These 
optimizations requires the [`ruby-version`][2] gem available.
