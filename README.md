**hash-utils** gem adds more than 147 useful and frequently rather 
fundamental methods which are missing in Ruby programming language, 
to several core classes. It tries to be similar project to 
[Ruby Facets][1] on principle, but less complex, more practical, 
non-atomic and organized by better way.

- `Array` &ndash; 27 methods,
- `FalseClass` &ndash; 3 methods,
- `File` &ndash; 2 methods,
- `Gem` &ndash; 2 methods,
- `Hash` &ndash; 42 methods,
- `IO` &ndash; 1 method,
- `Module` &ndash; 1 method,
- `NilClass` &ndash; 1 method,
- `Numeric` &ndash; 5 method,
- `Object` &ndash; 15 methods,
- `Proc` &ndash; 1 method,
- `String` &ndash; 37 methods,
- `StringIO` &ndash; 1 method,
- `Symbol` &ndash; 8 methods,
- `TrueClass` &ndash; 3 methods.
