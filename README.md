Hash Utils
==========

**hash Utils** adds some utility methods well known from [Array][1]
cl  ass to [Hash][2] class. Extends it with following methods:

* [#compact][3] -- rejects elements with `nil` values,
* [#compact!][4]
* #map_pairs -- works as [Array#map][5], but for whole pair,
* #map_pairs!
* #map_keys -- works as [Array#map][5], but for keys only,
* #map_keys!
* keys_to_sym -- converts all keys to [Symbols][6],
* keys_to_sym!

All methods with `!` emulates work *in place*, but in fact they will 
replace old hash with new one. An example of use: 

    foo = {"a" => 1, "b" => 2}
    foo.map_keys! { |k| k.to_sym }
    
    # result is 
    #   {:a => 1, :b => 2}
    
This one is #keys_to_sym! for example.
