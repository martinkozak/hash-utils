Hash Utils
==========

**Hash Utils** adds a lot of useful fundamental utility methods which 
are missing in Ruby, both to [Array][1] and [Hash][2] classes and 
introduces some useful methods and syntactic sugar to [Numeric][7], 
[Symbol][6] and [String][8] classes too.

For full reference and methods lists, see **[documentation][3]**.

### Modularization

If you don't want to include whole library, you can include extensions 
to appropriate type only by including the:

    require "hash-utils/<lowercase-data-type-name>"
